# Description

> The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

# Installation

> Use node.js, path, fs, and inquirer installed through npm install in the terminal, then: to run this application on terminal CLI. Use terminal window to call nodemon - node app.js - on the command line interface to generate questions to the user for Team Member's information.

# Usage

 **As a manager of web development team:**
>   I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info;
    so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles and remember the school that our interns working from.
#### **User input**

The project prompts the user to build an engineering team. An engineering
team consists of a manager, and any number of engineers and interns.

#### **Roster output**

The project must generate a `team.html` page in the `output` directory, that displays a nicely formatted team roster. Each team member should display the following in no particular order:

  * Name

  * Role

  * ID

  * Role-specific property (School, link to GitHub profile, or office number)

  * Validation of id and email are added to ensure that the information provided is in the proper expected format.
